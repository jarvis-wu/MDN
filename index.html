    <h1>Jarvis Wu</h1>
    <p>Hey there, I’m Jarvis, a student, a developer, a designer and a guitar player. I live in Waterloo but originally came from a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhu">city</a> in China (by saying small I mean one with over 3.5M population since that’s China). I love to <a href="#">work</a> with awesome people, <a href="https://github.com/jarvis-wu">tinker</a> with interesting projects, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jarvis.z.wu/">shoot</a> beautiful photographs. Love to chat about society, people in our lives, delicious food, cool techs and a lot more.</p>
    <p>Reach me at hi@jarviswu.me.</p>
